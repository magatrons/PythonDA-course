# Week 1: Basics of Python

Welcome to Week 1 of the **Foundations of Data Analytics with Python** course. This week focuses on fundamental Python concepts that will set the stage for the rest of the course.

## Instructions to Use the Colab File

We will be using a Jupyter notebook titled **Week_1_&_2_Basics_of_Python.ipynb**. You can access and run the notebook in Google Colab. Here's how:

1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. Click on `File > Open Notebook`.
3. Under the `GitHub` tab, paste the URL of the course repository.
4. In the home directory of the repository, open the file titled `Week_1_&_2_Basics_of_Python.ipynb`.
5. Follow along with the code cells and run them by clicking the play button to execute the Python code.

## Guide: Presentation for Week 1

The theoretical content for Week 1 is available in the presentation titled **week 1 Presentation**, located in the `Week 1`. Please refer to the presentation for an in-depth explanation of the key topics covered in this week.

## Summary of Week 1 Topics

- **Variables**: Learn how to declare variables in Python, assign values, and understand the concept of dynamically typed variables.
  
- **Data Types**: Explore Python's built-in data types, including integers, floats, strings, and how they are used to store data.

- **Input/Output**: Understand how to take user input using the `input()` function and display output using the `print()` function.

- **Conditional Statements**: Learn to control the flow of your program using conditional statements such as `if`, `elif`, and `else`, including how to write programs with multiple conditions and nested conditional structures.
