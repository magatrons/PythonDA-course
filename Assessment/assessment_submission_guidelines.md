# Assessment Submission Instructions and Guidelines

 ## 1. Submission Form 
- Use the form [here](https://airtable.com/appkB4tLGaUIf7rIf/shrrXoOZ2fB7FWeRx) or https://airtable.com/appkB4tLGaUIf7rIf/shrrXoOZ2fB7FWeRx to submit your Google Colab notebook link or GitHub repository link.

## 2. Link Sharing & Accessibility
- Submissions with restricted access will not be graded until permissions are corrected.
- **Submission via Google Colab**:
  - Ensure the Google Colab Notebook link is publicly accessible: Set the notebook link to "Anyone with the link can view." 
- **Submission via GitHub**:
  - If submitting via GitHub, ensure the repository is public, with a direct link to the notebook.

## 3. Code Clarity and Structure
- **Code Comments and Documentation**:
  - Comment each significant block of code to explain its purpose and functionality.
  - Use comments to clarify complex code sections, especially non-obvious operations or logic.
  - Keep comments clear and concise to enhance understanding without over-explaining.

## 4. Visual Presentation of Data and Results
- **Output Clarity**:
  - Clearly present all outputs (e.g., graphs, data tables) so they correspond directly to the questions answered.
- **Effective Use of Data Visualizations**:
  - When required, include visualizations (e.g., line plots, bar charts, histograms) to enhance data presentation and insights.
  - Each visualization should include proper titles, axis labels, and legends (if applicable).
